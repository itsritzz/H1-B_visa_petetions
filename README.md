### Introduction
The H1B visa is a type of temporary work visa that allows highly skilled foreign workers to work in the United States. It is typically sponsored by a U.S. employer who is willing to offer the foreign worker a job and pay them a prevailing wage for their occupation. It is valid for up to three years and can be extended for an additional three years. To apply for an H1B visa, post an initial Labor Condition Application process approval, the employer can file an H1B visa petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). If the petition is approved, the foreign worker can then apply for an H1B visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in their home country.

### Problem Statement
The impact of Covid-19 on the job market and global economy has led to a dearth of knowledge among H1B visa aspirants such as graduate students, mid-career professionals regarding factors such as approval rate, wage, etc which could be high for certain job titles, wage levels, industries, etc. As a result, many individuals are unsure on how to take their career forward. Therefore, the aim of this project is to provide accurate information on which factors have been majorly affected due to Covid-19 by utilizing data visualization, descriptive and inferential statistical methods. From the inferences, comparative trends in critical impact factors will be declared. This shall bridge the knowledge gap and provide clarity to our target audience by bridging their knowledge gap and answering the big question i.e., whether Covid-19 had an impact on the H-1B petition process.

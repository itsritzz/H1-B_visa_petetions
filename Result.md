After our analysis, we found that despite COVID-19's impact on the labour market and the global economy, the H-1B petition filing process has not been significantly changed. However, because of the global uncertainty caused by the pandemic, applicants filing for H-1B visas are less informed about the current scenario of the trends. Based on the data visualization, the stacked bar chart in Figure 2 shows a rise in the proportion of certified cases and a fall in the proportion of denied cases following the pandemic. The median of prevailing wages has increased after the pandemic, according to the box plot in Figure 3. In the pre-covid 19 scenarios compared to the post-covid 19 scenario, Figure 4 shows a significant increase in visa petitions filed for the computer and mathematical, management, life, physical and social science, and architecture industries while a decrease in petitions filed for the business and financial operations, art design, entertainment, sports, and media industries. Figure 5 indicates that the processing time log for petitions submitted increased marginally from 4-5 days prior to Covid to 5-6 days following Covid, proving that Covid did not significantly affect processing time.

Majorly California experienced an increase in H-1B petitions post-covid 19, while Texas and states on both coasts, including New Jersey, New York, and Washington, saw a minor decline in petitions filed compared to pre-covid 19 (Figure 6). According to the number of applicants, the average income is shown in Figure 7's scatter plot, with the legal, computer, and mathematics industries being the only pre- and post-covid 19 outliers.

Based on the heatmap presented, most petitions filed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were concentrated in the eastern region. It is important to note, however, that this distribution may have shifted in response to the pandemic, as many individuals and businesses have relocated or altered their behaviour due to changing circumstances. Overall, this analysis has provided valuable insights towards solving the knowledge gap for our target audience.
